"The **Relaxation Dart Throwing Filter** is a variation on Poisson "
"sampling. The approach was first introduced by [McCool1992]_. The filter "
"operates nearly identically to :ref:`filters.sample`, except it will "
"continue to shrink the radius with each pass through the point cloud "
"until the desired number of output points is reached."

"The ``shuffle`` option does not reorder points in the PointView, but "
