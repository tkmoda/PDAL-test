"GDAL processing operations applied to raster output from "
":ref:`writers.gdal` are a common task. Applying these within the PDAL "
"execution environment can provide some convenience and allow downstream "
"consumers to have deterministic completion status of the task. The "
"following task writes multiple elevation models to disk and then uses the"
" `gdaladdo <https://gdal.org/gdaladdo.html>`__ command to construct "
"overview bands for the data using average interpolation."

"merged into the returned point view provided that only one point view is "
"returned and it has the same point count as it did when the filter was "
"run. [Default: ``auto``]"
