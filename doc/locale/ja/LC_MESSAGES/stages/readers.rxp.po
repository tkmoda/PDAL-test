"To build PDAL with rxp support, set RiVLib_DIR to the path of your local "
"RiVLib installation.  RiVLib can be obtained from the `RIEGL download "
"pages`_ with a properly enabled user account.  The RiVLib files do not "
"need to be in a system-level directory, though they could be (e.g. they "
"could be in ``/usr/local``, or just in your home directory somewhere)."

msgid ""
"This example rescales the points, given in the scanner's own coordinate "
"system, to values that can be written to a las file.  Only points with a "
"valid gps time, as determined by a pps pulse, are read from the rxp, "
"since the ``sync_to_pps`` option is \"true\".  Reflectance values are "
"mapped to intensity values using sensible defaults."

"We set the ``discard_high_return_numbers`` option to ``true`` on the "
":ref:`writers.las`.  RXP files can contain more returns per shot than is "
"supported by las, and so we need to explicitly tell the las writer to "
"ignore those high return number points.  You could also use "
":ref:`filters.python` to filter those points earlier in the pipeline."
