"Normalized heights are a commonly used attribute of point cloud data. "
"This can also be referred to as *height above ground* (HAG) or *above "
"ground level* (AGL) heights. In the end, it is simply a measure of a "
"point's relative height as opposed to its raw elevation value."

"The filter creates a delaunay triangulation of the `count`_ ground points"
" closest to the non-ground point in question.  If the non-ground point is"
" within the triangulated area, the assigned ``HeightAboveGround`` is the "
"difference between its ``Z`` value and a ground height interpolated from "
"the three vertices of the containing triangle.  If the non-ground point "
"is outside of the triangulated area, its ``HeightAboveGround`` is "
"calculated as the difference between its ``Z`` value and the ``Z`` value "
"of the nearest ground point."

msgid ""
"Choosing a value for `count`_ is difficult, as placing the non-ground "
"point in the triangulated area depends on the layout of the nearby "
"points.  If, for example, all the ground points near a non-ground point "
"lay on one side of that non-ground point, finding a containing triangle "
"will fail."
