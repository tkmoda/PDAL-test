"The **neighborclassifier filter** allows you update the value of the "
"classification for specific points to a value determined by a K-nearest "
"neighbors vote. For each point, the k_ nearest neighbors are queried and "
"if more than half of them have the same value, the filter updates the "
"selected point accordingly"

"For example, if an automated classification procedure put/left erroneous "
"vegetation points near the edges of buildings which were largely "
"classified correctly, you could try using this filter to fix that "
"problem."

"Similiarly, some automated classification processes result in prediction "
"for only a subset of the original point cloud.  This filter could be used"
