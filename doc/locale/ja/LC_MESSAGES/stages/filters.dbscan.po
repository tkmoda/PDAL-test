"The DBSCAN filter performs Density-Based Spatial Clustering of "
"Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) [Ester1996]_ and labels each point with "
"its associated cluster ID. Points that do not belong to a cluster are "
"given a Cluster ID of -1. The remaining clusters are labeled as integers "
"starting from 0."

"The minimum cluster size ``min_points`` should be greater than or equal "
