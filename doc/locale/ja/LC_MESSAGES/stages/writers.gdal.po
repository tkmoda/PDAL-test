"The **GDAL writer** creates a raster from a point cloud using an "
"interpolation algorithm.  Output is produced using `GDAL`_ and can use "
"any `driver that supports creation of rasters`_.  A data_type_ can be "
"specified for the raster (double, float, int32, etc.).  If no data type "
"is specified, the data type with the largest range supported by the "
"driver is used."

"The technique used to create the raster is a simple interpolation where "
"each point that falls within a given radius_ of a raster cell center "
"potentially contributes to the raster's value.  If no radius is provided,"
" it is set to the product of the resolution_ and the square root of two. "
"If a circle with the provided radius doesn't encompass the entire cell, "
"it is possible that some points will not be considered at all, including "
"those that may be within the bounds of the raster cell."
