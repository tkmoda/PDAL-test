"The **Raster Writer** writes an existing raster to a file. Output is "
"produced using `GDAL`_ and can use any `driver that supports creation of "
"rasters`_.  A ``data_type`` can be specified for the raster (double, "
"float, int32, etc.).  If no data type is specified, the data type with "
"the largest range supported by the driver is used."
