"`Draco`_ is a library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric "
"meshes and point clouds and was designed and built for compression "
"efficiency and speed. The code supports compressing points, connectivity "
"information, texture coordinates, color information, normals, and any "
"other generic attributes associated with geometry."
