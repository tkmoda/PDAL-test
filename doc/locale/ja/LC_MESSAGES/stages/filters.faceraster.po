"The **FaceRaster filter** creates a raster from a point cloud using an "
"algorithm based on an existing triangulation.  Each raster cell is given "
"a value that is an interpolation of the known values of the containing "
"triangle.  If the raster cell center is outside of the triangulation, it "
"is assigned the nodata_ value.  Use `writers.raster` to write the output."
