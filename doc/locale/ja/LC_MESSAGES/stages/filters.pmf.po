"The **Progressive Morphological Filter (PMF)** is a method of segmenting "

"initial_distance_ is _intended_ to be set to account for z noise, so for "
"a flat surface if you have an uncertainty of around 15 cm, you set "

"For a given iteration, the height threshold is determined by multiplying "
"slope by cell_size_ by the difference in window size between the current "
"and last iteration, plus the initial_distance_. This height threshold is "
"constant across all cells and is maxed out at the max_distance_ value. If"
" the difference in elevation between a point and its “opened” value (from"
" the morphological operator) exceeds the height threshold, it is treated "
"as non-ground.  So, bigger slope leads to bigger height thresholds, and "
"these grow with each iteration (not to exceed the max).  With flat "
"terrain, keep this low, the thresholds are small, and stuff is more "
"aggressively dumped into non-ground class.  In rugged terrain, open "
"things up a little, but then you can start missing buildings, veg, etc."

"exponential_ is used to control the rate of growth of morphological "

"time. The default behavior is to grow the window sizes exponentially, "
"thus reducing the number of iterations."
