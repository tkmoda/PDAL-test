"List of header fields whose values should be preserved from a source LAS "

"effect as listing values separated by a comma.  The following values are "
"valid: ``filesource_id``, ``global_encoding``, ``project_id``, "
"``system_id``, ``software_id``, ``creation_doy``, ``creation_year``, "
"``scale_x``, ``scale_y``, ``scale_z``, ``offset_x``, ``offset_y``, "
"``offset_z``.  In addition, the special value ``header`` can be "
"specified, which is equivalent to specifying all the values EXCEPT the "
"scale and offset values.  Scale and offset values can be forwarded as a "
"group by using the special values ``scale`` and ``offset`` respectively."
"  The special value ``all`` is equivalent to specifying ``header``, "
"``scale``, ``offset`` and ``vlr`` (see below).  If a header option is "
"specified explicitly, it will override any forwarded header value. If a "
"LAS file is the result of multiple LAS input files, the header values to "
"be forwarded must match or they will be ignored and a default will be "

"will be rebuilt properly in the output file as necessary.  Unlike header "
