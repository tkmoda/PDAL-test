"The mbio reader allows sonar bathymetry data to be read into PDAL and "
"treated as data collected using LIDAR sources.  PDAL uses the `MB-"
"System`_ library to read the data and therefore supports `all formats`_ "
"supported by that library.  Some common sonar systems are NOT supported "
"by MB-System, notably Kongsberg, Reson and Norbit.  The mbio reader reads"
" each \"beam\" of data after averaging and processing by the MB-System "
"software and stores the values for the dimensions 'X', 'Y', 'Z' and "
"'Amplitude'.  X and Y use longitude and latitude for units and the Z "
"values are in meters (negative, being below the surface).  Units for "
"'Amplitude' is not specified and may vary."
