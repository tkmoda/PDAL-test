"The **OGR Writer** will create files of various `vector formats`_ as "
"supported by the OGR library.  PDAL points are generally stored as point "
"geometries in the output format, though PDAL will create multipoint "
"geometries instead if the multicount_ option is set to a value greater "
"than 1. Points can be written with a additional measure value (POINTZM) "
"if measure_dim_ specifies a valid PDAL dimension, and dimensions can be "
"set as feature attributes using the attr_dims_ option."
