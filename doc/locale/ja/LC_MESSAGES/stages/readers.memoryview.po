"The memoryview reader is a special stage that allows the reading of point"
" data arranged in rows directly from memory -- each point needs to have "
"dimension data arranged at a fixed offset from a base address of the "
"point. Before each point is read, the memoryview reader calls a function "
"that should return the point's base address, or a null pointer if there "
"are no points to be read."

"After creating an instance of the memoryview reader, the user should call"
" pushField() for every dimension that should be read from memory. "
"pushField() takes a single argument, a MemoryViewReader::Field, that "
"consists of a dimension name, a type and an offset from the point base "
"address:"

"The user should also call setIncrementer(), a function that takes a "
"single argument, a std::function that receives the ID of the point to be "
"added and should return the base address of the point data, or a null "
"pointer if there are no more points to be read."
