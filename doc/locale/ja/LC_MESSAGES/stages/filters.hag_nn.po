"Normalized heights are a commonly used attribute of point cloud data. "
"This can also be referred to as *height above ground* (HAG) or *above "
"ground level* (AGL) heights. In the end, it is simply a measure of a "
"point's relative height as opposed to its raw elevation value."

"The filter finds the `count`_ ground points nearest the non-ground point "
"under consideration.  It calculates an average ground height weighted by "
"the distance of each ground point from the non-ground point.  The "
"``HeightAboveGround`` is the difference between the ``Z`` value of the "
"non-ground point and the interpolated ground height."
