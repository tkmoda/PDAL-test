"The **VoxelCentroidNearestNeighbor Filter** is a voxel-based sampling "
"filter. The input point cloud is divided into 3D voxels at the given cell"
" size. For each populated voxel, we apply the following ruleset. For "
"voxels with only one point, the point is passed through to the output. "
"For voxels with exactly two points, the point closest the voxel center is"
" returned. Finally, for voxels with more than two points, the centroid of"
" the points within that voxel is computed. This centroid is used as the "
"query point in a 3D nearest neighbor search (considering only those "
"points lying within the voxel). The nearest neighbor is then added to the"
" output point cloud, along with any existing dimensions."

"A strategy for merging points skipped by a '`where'` option when running "

"point view returned by the skipped filter. If ``false``, skipped points "
"are placed in their own point view. If ``auto``, skipped points are "

"returned and it has the same point count as it did when the filter was "
"run. [Default: ``auto``]"
