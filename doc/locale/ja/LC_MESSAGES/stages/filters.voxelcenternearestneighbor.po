"The **VoxelCenterNearestNeighbor filter** is a voxel-based sampling "
"filter. The input point cloud is divided into 3D voxels at the given cell"
" size. For each populated voxel, the coordinates of the voxel center are "
"used as the query point in a 3D nearest neighbor search. The nearest "
"neighbor is then added to the output point cloud, along with any existing"
" dimensions."

":ref:`filters.voxelcentroidnearestneighbor` offers a similar solution, "
"using as the query point the centroid of all points falling within the "
"voxel as opposed to the voxel center coordinates.  The drawback with this"
" approach is that all dimensional data is lost, leaving the the sampled "
"cloud consisting of only XYZ coordinates."

"A strategy for merging points skipped by a '`where'` option when running "
"in standard mode. If ``true``, the skipped points are added to the first "
"point view returned by the skipped filter. If ``false``, skipped points "
"are placed in their own point view. If ``auto``, skipped points are "
"merged into the returned point view provided that only one point view is "
"returned and it has the same point count as it did when the filter was "
"run. [Default: ``auto``]"
