"The **outlier filter** provides two outlier filtering methods: radius and"
" statistical. These two approaches are discussed in further detail below."

"It is worth noting that both filtering methods simply apply a "
"classification value of 7 to the noise points (per the `LAS "
"specification`_). To remove the noise points altogether, users can add a "
":ref:`range filter<filters.range>` to their pipeline, downstream from the"

msgid ""
"The default method for identifying outlier points is the statistical "
"outlier method. This method requires two passes through the input "

"statistics, and second to identify outliers using the computed threshold."
