"The **reprojection filter** converts the X, Y and/or Z dimensions to a "
"new spatial reference system. The old coordinates are replaced by the new"
" ones. If you want to preserve the old coordinates for future processing,"
" use a :ref:`filters.ferry` to create copies of the original dimensions "

"This pipeline reprojects terrain points with Z-values between 0 and 100 "
"by first applying a range filter and then specifying both the input and "
"output spatial reference as EPSG-codes. The X and Y dimensions are scaled"
" to allow enough precision in the output coordinates."

"In some cases it is not possible to use a EPSG-code as a spatial "
"reference. Instead `Proj.4 <http:/proj4.org>`_ parameters can be used to "
"define a spatial reference.  In this example the vertical component of "
"points in a laz file is converted from geometric (ellipsoidal) heights to"
" orthometric heights by using the ``geoidgrids`` parameter from Proj.4.  "
"Here we change the vertical datum from the GRS80 ellipsoid to DVR90, the "
"vertical datum in Denmark. In the writing stage of the pipeline the "
"spatial reference of the file is set to EPSG:7416. The last step is "
"needed since PDAL will otherwise reference the vertical datum as "
"\"Unnamed Vertical Datum\" in the spatial reference VLR."
