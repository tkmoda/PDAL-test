"The **text reader** reads data from ASCII text files.  Each point is "
"represented in the file as a single line.  Each line is expected to be "
"divided into a number of fields by a separator.  Each field represents a "
"value for a point's dimension.  Each value needs to be `formatted`_ "
"properly for C++ language double-precision values."

"character is expected between the dimension names (spaces are stripped)."
"  If no separator character is found, a space is assumed.  You can set "
"the `separator`_ character if it differs from that in the header.  Note "
"that PDAL requires dimension names that consist only of alphabetic "
"characters and underscores.  Edit the header line or use the `header`_ "
"option to set the dimension names to ones that PDAL understands."
