"The **Miniball Criterion** was introduced in [Weyrich2004]_ and is based "
"on the assumption that points that are distant to the cluster built by "
"their k-neighborhood are likely to be outliers. First, the smallest "
"enclosing ball is computed for the k-neighborhood, giving a center point "
"and radius [Fischer2010]_. The miniball criterion is then computed by "
"comparing the distance (from the current point to the miniball center) to"
" the radius of the miniball."

"The author suggests that the Miniball Criterion is more robust than the "
":ref:`Plane Fit Criterion <filters.planefit>` around high-frequency "
"details, but demonstrates poor outlier detection for points close to a "
"smooth surface."

"The sample pipeline below computes the Miniball criterion with a "
"neighborhood of 8 neighbors. We do not apply a fixed threshold to single "
"out outliers based on the Miniball criterion as the range of values can "
"vary from one dataset to another. In general, higher values indicate the "
"likelihood of a point being an outlier."
