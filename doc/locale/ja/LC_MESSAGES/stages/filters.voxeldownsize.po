"The **voxeldownsize filter** is a voxel-based sampling filter. The input "
"point cloud is divided into 3D voxels at the given cell size. For each "
"populated voxel, either first point entering in the voxel or center of a "
"voxel (depending on mode argument) is accepted and voxel is marked as "
"populated.  All other points entering in the same voxel are filtered out."

":ref:`filters.voxelcenternearestneighbor` offers a similar solution, "
"using the coordinates of the voxel center as the query point in a 3D "
"nearest neighbor search.  The nearest neighbor is then added to the "
"output point cloud, along with any existing dimensions."

"A strategy for merging points skipped by a '`where'` option when running "

"returned and it has the same point count as it did when the filter was "
"run. [Default: ``auto``]"
