"GLTF is a file format `specification`_ for 3D graphics data. If a mesh "
"has been generated for a PDAL point view, the **GLTF Writer** will "
"produce simple output in the GLTF format.  PDAL does not currently "
"support many of the attributes that can be found in a GLTF file.  This "
"writer creates a *binary* GLTF (extension '.glb')."
