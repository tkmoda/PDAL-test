"The reader also supports compressed LAS files, known as LAZ files or "
"`LASzip`_ files. In order to use compressed LAS (LAZ), your version of "
"PDAL must be built with one of the two supported decompressors, `LASzip`_"
" or `LAZperf`_. See the :ref:`compression <las_compression>` option below"

"LAS stores X, Y and Z dimensions as scaled integers.  Users converting an"
" input LAS file to an output LAS file will frequently want to use the "
"same scale factors and offsets in the output file as existed in the input"
" file in order to maintain the precision of the data.  Use the `forward` "
"option on the :ref:`writers.las` to facilitate transfer of header "
"information from source to destination LAS/LAZ files."

"LAS 1.4 files can contain datatypes that are actually arrays rather than "
"individual dimensions.  Since PDAL doesn't support these datatypes, it "
"must map them into datatypes it supports.  This is done by appending the "
"array index to the name of the datatype.  For example, datatypes 11 - 20 "
"are two dimensional array types and if a field had the name Foo for "
"datatype 11, PDAL would create the dimensions Foo0 and Foo1 to hold the "
"values associated with LAS field Foo.  Similarly, datatypes 21 - 30 are "
"three dimensional arrays and a field of type 21 with the name Bar would "
"cause PDAL to create dimensions Bar0, Bar1 and Bar2.  See the information"
" on the extra bytes VLR in the `LAS Specification`_ for more information "
"on the extra bytes VLR and array datatypes."
