"The **Stats Filter** calculates the minimum, maximum and average (mean) "
"values of dimensions.  On request it will also provide an enumeration of "
"values of a dimension and skewness and kurtosis."

"The output of the stats filter is metadata that can be stored by writers "
"or used through the PDAL API.  Output from the stats filter can also be "
"quickly obtained in JSON format by using the command \"pdal info "
"--stats\"."

"The filter can compute both sample and population statistics.  For "
"kurtosis, the filter can also compute standard and excess kurtosis.  "
"However, only a single value is reported for each statistic type in "
"metadata, and that is the sample statistic, rather than the population "
"statistic.  For kurtosis the sample excess kurtosis is reported.  This "
"seems to match the behavior of many other software packages."
