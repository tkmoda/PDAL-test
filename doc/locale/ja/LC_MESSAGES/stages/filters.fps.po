":ref:`filters.sample` produces a similar result, but while "
"``filters.sample`` allows us to target a desired separation of points via"
" the ``radius`` parameter at the expense of knowing the number of points "
"in the output, ``filters.fps`` allows us to specify exactly the number of"
" output points at the expense of knowing beforehand the spacing between "
"points."

"A strategy for merging points skipped by a '`where'` option when running "

"point view returned by the skipped filter. If ``false``, skipped points "
"are placed in their own point view. If ``auto``, skipped points are "
"merged into the returned point view provided that only one point view is "
"returned and it has the same point count as it did when the filter was "
"run. [Default: ``auto``]"
