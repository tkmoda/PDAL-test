"A common questions for users of point clouds is what the spatial extent "
"of a point cloud collection is. Files generally provide only rectangular "
"bounds, but often the points inside the files only fill up a small "
"percentage of the area within the bounds."

"The hexbin filter reads a point stream and writes out a metadata record "

" should be included as part of the boundary.  In order to write out the "
"metadata record, the *pdal* pipeline command must be invoked using the "
"\"--pipeline-serialization\" option:"
