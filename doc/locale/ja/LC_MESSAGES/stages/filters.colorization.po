"The colorization filter populates dimensions in the point buffer using "
"input values read from a raster file. Commonly this is used to add "
"Red/Green/Blue values to points from an aerial photograph of an area. "
"However, any band can be read from the raster and applied to any "
"dimension name desired."

"Certain data configurations can cause degenerate filter behavior. One "

" One driver which can have issues is when a `TIFF`_ file is striped vs. "
"tiled. GDAL's data access in that situation is likely to cause lots of "
"re-reading if the cache isn't large enough."
