"The **straighten filter** transforms the point cloud in a new parametric "
"coordinate system, each point in world coordinate (X,Y,Z) is being "
"projected along closest poyline segment, and rotated along the segment "
"accordingly to the average m/roll value."

"The new coordinate system (X', Y', Z') could be understood as : * X' : "
"curvilinear abcissa (or meter point) * Y' : orthogonal distance to "
"segment (or orthogonal distance to line) * Z' : orthogonal distance from "
"(rolling) plane"
