"The stages of a PDAL :ref:`pipeline` are divided into :ref:`readers`, "
":ref:`filters` and :ref:`writers`. Stages may support :ref:`streaming "
"mode <processing_modes>` or not, depending on their functionality or "
"particular implementation.  Many stages are built into the base PDAL "
"library (the file pdalcpp.so on Unix, pdalcpp.dylib on OSX and "
"pdalcpp.dll on Windows).  PDAL can also load stages that have been built "
"separately. These stages are called plugins."

"Stages are usually created as plugins for one of several reasons. First, "
"a user may wish to create a stage for their own purposes. In this case a "
"user has no need to build their stage into the PDAL library itself. "
"Second, a stage may depend on some third-party library that cannot be "
"distributed with PDAL.  Providing the stage as a plugin eliminates the "
"direct dependency on a library and can simplify licensing issues.  Third,"
" a stage may be little used and its addition would unnecessarily increase"
" the size of the PDAL library."

"PDAL will automatically load plugins when necessary. PDAL plugins have a "
"specific naming pattern:"

"Where <plugin type> is \"reader\", \"writer\" or \"filter\" and <shared "
"library extension> is \".dll\" on Windows, \".dylib\" on OSX and \".so\" "
"on UNIX systems."

"The <plugin name> must start with a letter or number, which can be "
"followed by letters, numbers, or an underscore ('_')."

"PDAL looks for plugins in the directory that contains the PDAL library "
"itself, as well as the directories ``.``, ``./lib``, ``../lib``, "
"``./bin``, ``../bin``. Those paths are relative to the current working "
"directory.  These locations can be overridden by setting the environment "
"variable ``PDAL_DRIVER_PATH`` to a list of directories delimited by ``;``"
" on Windows and ``:`` on other platforms."

"You can use ``pdal --drivers`` to show stages that PDAL is able to load."
"  Verify the above if you are having trouble loading specific plugins."
