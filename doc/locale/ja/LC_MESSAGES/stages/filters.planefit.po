"The **Plane Fit Criterion** was introduced in [Weyrich2004]_ and computes"
" the deviation of a point from a manifold approximating its neighbors.  "
"First, a plane is fit to each point's k-neighborhood by performing an "
"eigenvalue decomposition. Next, the mean point to plane distance is "
"computed by considering all points within the neighborhood. This is "
"compared to the point to plane distance of the current point giving rise "
"to the k-neighborhood. As the mean distance of the k-neighborhood "
"approaches 0, the Plane Fit criterion will tend toward 1. As point to "
"plane distance of the current point approaches 0, the Plane Fit criterion"
" will tend toward 0."

"The author suggests that the Plane Fit Criterion is well suited to "
"outlier detection when considering noisy reconstructions of smooth "

"The sample pipeline below computes the Plane Fit criterion with a "
"neighborhood of 8 neighbors. We do not apply a fixed threshold to single "
"out outliers based on the Plane Fit criterion as the range of values can "
"vary from one dataset to another. In general, higher values indicate the "
"likelihood of a point being an outlier."
