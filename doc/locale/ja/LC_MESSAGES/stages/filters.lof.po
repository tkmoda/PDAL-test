"The **Local Outlier Factor (LOF) filter** was introduced as a method of "
"determining the degree to which an object is an outlier. This filter is "
"an implementation of the method described in [Breunig2000]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../stages/filters.lof.rst:11
msgid ""
"The filter creates three new dimensions, ``NNDistance``, "
"``LocalReachabilityDistance`` and ``LocalOutlierFactor``, all of which "
"are double-precision floating values. The ``NNDistance`` dimension "
"records the Euclidean distance between a point and it's k-th nearest "
"neighbor (the number of k neighbors is set with the minpts_ option). The "
"``LocalReachabilityDistance`` is the inverse of the mean of all "
"reachability distances for a neighborhood of points. This reachability "
"distance is defined as the max of the Euclidean distance to a neighboring"
" point and that neighbor's own previously computed ``NNDistance``. "
"Finally, each point has a ``LocalOutlierFactor`` which is the mean of all"
" ``LocalReachabilityDistance`` values for the neighborhood. In each case,"
" the neighborhood is the set of k nearest neighbors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../stages/filters.lof.rst:24
msgid ""
"In practice, setting the minpts_ parameter appropriately and subsequently"
" filtering outliers based on the computed ``LocalOutlierFactor`` can be "
"difficult. The authors present some work on establishing upper and lower "
"bounds on LOF values, and provide some guidelines on selecting minpts_ "
"values, which users of this filter should find instructive."

"To inspect the newly created, non-standard dimensions, be sure to write "

"A strategy for merging points skipped by a '`where'` option when running "

"merged into the returned point view provided that only one point view is "
"returned and it has the same point count as it did when the filter was "
"run. [Default: ``auto``]"
