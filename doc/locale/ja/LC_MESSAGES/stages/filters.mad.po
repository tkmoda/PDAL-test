"The **MAD filter** filter crops the input point cloud based on the "
"distribution of points in the specified dimension_. Specifically, we "
"choose the method of median absolute deviation from the median (commonly "
"referred to as MAD), which is robust to outliers (as opposed to mean and "
"standard deviation)."

msgid ""
"This method can remove real data, especially ridges and valleys in rugged"
" terrain, or tall features such as towers and rooftops in flat terrain. "
"While the number of deviations can be adjusted to account for such "
"content-specific considerations, it must be used with care."

"The sample pipeline below uses filters.mad to automatically crop the "
"``Z`` dimension and remove possible outliers. The number of deviations "
"from the median has been adjusted to be less aggressive and to only crop "
"those outliers that are greater than four deviations from the median."

"A strategy for merging points skipped by a '`where'` option when running "

"point view returned by the skipped filter. If ``false``, skipped points "
"are placed in their own point view. If ``auto``, skipped points are "
"merged into the returned point view provided that only one point view is "
"returned and it has the same point count as it did when the filter was "
"run. [Default: ``auto``]"
