"The Cluster filter first performs Euclidean Cluster Extraction on the "
"input ``PointView`` and then labels each point with its associated "
"cluster ID. It creates a new dimension ``ClusterID`` that contains the "
"cluster ID value. Cluster IDs start with the value 1.  Points that don't "
"belong to any cluster will are given a cluster ID of 0."
