"The **Interquartile Range Filter** automatically crops the input point "
"cloud based on the distribution of points in the specified dimension. The"
" Interquartile Range (IQR) is defined as the range between the first and "
"third quartile (25th and 75th percentile). Upper and lower bounds are "
"determined by adding 1.5 times the IQR to the third quartile or "
"subtracting 1.5 times the IQR from the first quartile. The multiplier, "
"which defaults to 1.5, can be adjusted by the user."

"This method can remove real data, especially ridges and valleys in rugged"
" terrain, or tall features such as towers and rooftops in flat terrain. "
"While the number of deviations can be adjusted to account for such "
"content-specific considerations, it must be used with care."

"The sample pipeline below uses the filter to automatically crop the Z "
"dimension and remove possible outliers. The multiplier to determine "
"high/low thresholds has been adjusted to be less aggressive and to only "
"crop those outliers that are greater than the third quartile plus 3 times"
" the IQR or are less than the first quartile minus 3 times the IQR."
