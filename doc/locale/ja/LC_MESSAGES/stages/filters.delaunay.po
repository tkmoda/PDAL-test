"A strategy for merging points skipped by a '`where'` option when running "
"in standard mode. If ``true``, the skipped points are added to the first "
"point view returned by the skipped filter. If ``false``, skipped points "
"are placed in their own point view. If ``auto``, skipped points are "
"merged into the returned point view provided that only one point view is "
"returned and it has the same point count as it did when the filter was "
"run. [Default: ``auto``]"
