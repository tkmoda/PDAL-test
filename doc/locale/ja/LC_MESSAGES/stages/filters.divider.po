"The **Divider Filter** breaks a point view into a set of smaller point "
"views based on simple criteria.  The number of subsets can be specified "
"explicitly, or one can specify a maximum point count for each subset.  "
"Additionally, points can be placed into each subset sequentially (as they"
" appear in the input) or in round-robin fashion."
