"`GDAL` surreptitiously embeds a copy of `GeoTIFF`_ in its library build "
"but there is no way for you to know this.  In addition to embedding "
"libgeotiff, it also strips away the library symbols that PDAL needs, "
"meaning that PDAL can't simply link against `GDAL`_.  If you are building"
" both of these libraries yourself, make sure you build GDAL using the "
"\"External libgeotiff\" option, which will prevent the insanity that can "
"ensue on some platforms.  `Conda Forge`_ users, including those using "
"that platform to link and build PDAL themselves, do not need to worry "
"about this issue."
