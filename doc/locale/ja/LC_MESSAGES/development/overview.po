"PDAL is a set of applications and library to facilitate translation of "
"point cloud data between various formats.  In addition, it provides some "
"facilities for transformation of data between various geometric "
"projections and can calculate some statistical, boundary and density "
"data.  PDAL also provides point classification algorithms. PDAL provides "
"an API that can be used by programmers for integration into their own "
"projects or to allow extension of existing capabilities."

"PDAL reads data from a set of input sources using format-specific "
"readers. Point data can be passed through various filters that transform "
"data or create metadata.  If desired, points can be written to an output "
"stream using a format-specific writer.  PDAL can merge data from various "
"input sources into a single output source, preserving attribute data "
"where supported by the input and output formats."

"The above diagram shows a possible arrangement of PDAL readers, filters "
"and writers, all of which are known as stages.  Any merge operation or "
"filter may be placed after any reader.  Output filters are distinct from "
"other filters only in that they may create more than one set of points to"
" be further filtered or written.  The arrangement of readers, filters and"
" writers is called a PDAL pipeline.  Pipelines can be specified using "
"JSON as detailed later."

"PDAL is simple to extend by implementing subclasses of existing stages.  "
"All processing in PDAL is completely synchronous.  No parallel processing"
" occurs, eliminating locking or other concurrency issues.  Understanding "
"of several auxiliary classes is necessary to effectively create a new "
"stage."

"Point cloud formats support various data elements.  In order to be "
"useful, all formats must provide some notion of location for points (X, Y"
" and perhaps Z), but beyond that, the data collected in formats may or "
"may not have common data fields.  Some formats predefine the elements "
"that make up a point.  Other formats provide this information in a header"
" or preamble.  PDAL calls each of the elements that make up a point a "
"dimension.  PDAL predefines the dimensions that are in common use by the "
"formats that it currently supports.  Readers may register their use of a "
"predefined dimension or may have PDAL create a dimension with a name and "
"type as requested.  Dimensions are described in a JSON file, "
"Dimension.json."

#: ../../development/overview.rst:64
msgid ""
"PDAL has a default type (Double, Float, Signed32, etc.) for each of its "
"predefined dimensions which is believed to be sufficient to accurately "
"hold the necessary data.  Only when the default data type is deemed "
"insufficient should a request be made to \"upgrade\" a storage datatype."
"  There is no simple facility to \"downsize\" a dimension type to save "
"memory, though it can be done by creating a custom PointLayout object.  "
"Dimension.json can be examined to determine the default storage type of "
"each predefined dimension.  In most cases knowledge of the storage data "
"type for a dimension isn't required.  PDAL properly converts data to and "
"from the internal storage type transparently.  Invalid conversions raise "
"an exception."

msgid ""
"When a storage type is explicitly requested for a dimension, PDAL "
"examines the existing storage type and requested type and chooses the "
"storage type so that it can hold both types.  In some cases this results "
"in a storage type different from either the existing or requested storage"
" type.  For instance, if the current storage type is a 16 bit signed "
"integer (Signed16) and the requested type is a 16 bit unsigned integer "
"(Unsigned16), PDAL will use a 32 bit signed integer as the storage type "
"for the dimension so that both 16 bit storage types can be successfully "
"accommodated."

"A point view (PointView object) stores references to points.  Storage and"

"reference in a point view has a point ID of 0, the second has a point ID "
"of 1, the third has a point ID of 2 and so on.  There are no null point "
"references in a point view.  The size of a point view is the number of "
"point references contained in the view.  A point view acts like a self-"
"expanding array or vector of point references, but it is always full.  "
