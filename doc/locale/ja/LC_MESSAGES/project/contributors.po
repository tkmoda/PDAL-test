"Numerous organizations, companies, and individuals have contributed time,"
" money, and code to build PDAL up into a highly capable software package."

" quality wouldn't be as high. The development team is proud of the "
"software, and it collectively represents years of experiences doing point"
" cloud data management. We hope you'll find it useful too."
