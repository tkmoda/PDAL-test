"PDAL is a C++ library for translating and manipulating `point cloud "
"data`_.  It is very much like the `GDAL`_ library which handles raster "
"and vector data.  The :ref:`about` page provides high level overview of "
"the library and its philosophy. Visit :ref:`readers` and :ref:`writers` "
"to list data formats it supports, and see :ref:`filters` for filtering "
"operations that you can apply with PDAL."

"In addition to the library code, PDAL provides a suite of command-line "
"applications that users can conveniently use to process, filter, "
"translate, and query point cloud data.  :ref:`apps` provides more "
"information on that topic."
