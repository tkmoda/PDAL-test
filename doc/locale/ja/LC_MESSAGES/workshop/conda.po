"Conda is an open source package management system and environment "
"management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly "
"installs, runs, and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily"
" creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local "
"computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and "
"distribute software for any language."

"PDAL stands on the shoulders of giants. It uses GDAL, GEOS, and "
":ref:`many other dependencies <building>`. Because of this, it is very "
"challenging to build it yourself. We could easily burn an entire workshop"
" learning the esoteric build mysteries of PDAL and all of its "
"dependencies. Fortunately, Conda provides us a fully-featured known "
"configuration to run our examples and exercises without having to suffer "
"so much, and provides it for Windows, Linux, and macOS."

"Not everyone uses Conda. Another alternative to get a known configuration"
" is to go through the workshop using :ref:`docker <development_docker>` "
"as your platform. A previous edition of the workshop was provided using "
"Docker, but it was found to be a bit too difficult to follow."

"PDAL does not have a python wheel package and thus is distributed via "
"``conda-forge`` conda channel. If you would like to know more about the "
"limitations that prevent PDAL from being distributed as a pip package, "
"you can read about it at the `pypackaging-native website`_"
