"LiDAR is a remote sensing technique that uses visible or near-infrared "
"laser energy to measure the distance between a sensor and an object.  "
"LiDAR sensors are versatile and (often) mobile; they help autonomous cars"
" avoid obstacles and make detailed topographic measurements from space.  "
"Before diving into LiDAR data processing, we will spend a bit of time "
"reviewing some LiDAR fundamentals and discussing some terms of art."

msgid "LiDAR systems, generally speaking, come in one of three types:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../workshop/lidar-introduction.rst:18
msgid ""
"**Pulse-based**, or **linear-mode**, systems emit a pulse of laser energy"
" and measure the time it takes for that energy to travel to a target, "
"bounce off the target, and be returned to the sensor.  These systems are "
"called linear-mode because they (generally) only have a single aperture, "
"and so can only measure distance along a single vector at any point in "
"time. Pulse-based systems are very common, and are usually what you would"
" think of when you think of LiDAR."
msgstr ""

#: ../../workshop/lidar-introduction.rst:25
msgid ""
"**Phase-based** LiDAR systems measure distance via *interferometry*, that"
" is, by using the phase of a modulated laser beam to calculate a distance"
" as a fraction of the modulated signal's wavelength.  Phase-based systems"
" can be very precise, on the order of a few millimeters, but since they "
"require comparatively more energy than the other two types they are "
"usually used for short-range (e.g. indoor) scanning."

msgid ""
"**Geiger-mode**, or **photon-counting**, systems use extremely sensitive "
"detectors that can be triggered by a single photon. Since only a single "
"photon is required to trigger a measurement, these systems can operate at"
" much much higher altitudes than linear mode systems. However, Geiger-"
"mode systems are relatively new and suffer from very high amounts of "
"noise and other operational restrictions, making them significantly less "
"common than linear-mode systems."

"**Terrestrial LiDAR Scanning (TLS)**: scanning with a stationary LiDAR "
"sensor, usually mounted on a tripod."
msgstr ""

"**Airborne LiDAR scanning (ALS)**: also called airborne laser swath "
"mapping (ALSM), scanning with a LiDAR scanner mounted to a fixed-wing or "
"rotor aircraft."
msgstr ""

"**Unmanned LiDAR scanning (ULS)**: scanning with drones or other unmanned"

"With the exception of stationary TLS, LiDAR scanning generally requires "
"the use of an integrated GNSS/IMU (Global Navigation Satellite "
"System/Inertial Motion Unit), which provides information about the "
"position, rotation, and motion of the scanning platform."

"LiDAR scanners collect information in the Scanner's Own Coordinate System"
" (SOCS); this is a coordinate system centered at the scanner.  The "
"process of rotating, translating, and (possibly) transforming a point "
"cloud into a real-world spatial reference system is known as "
"**georeferencing**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../workshop/lidar-introduction.rst:81
msgid ""
"In the case of TLS, georeferencing is simply a matter of discovering the "
"position and orientation of the static scanner.  This is usually done "
"with GNSS control points, which are used to solve for the scanner's "
"position via least-squares."
msgstr ""

#: ../../workshop/lidar-introduction.rst:86
msgid ""
"For mobile or airborne LiDAR scanning, it is necessary to merge the "
"scanner's points with the GNSS/IMU data.  This can be done on-the-fly or "
"as a part of a post-processing workflow.  Since this is a common "
"operation for mobile and airborne LiDAR collects, we will spend a moment "
"discussing the methods and complications for georeferencing mobile LiDAR "
"and GNSS/IMU data."

"sampling.  In order to match the GNSS/IMU sampling rate with the sampling"

"While lever-arm offsets are usually taken from the schematic drawings of "
