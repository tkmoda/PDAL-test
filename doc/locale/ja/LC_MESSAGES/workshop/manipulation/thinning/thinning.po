"This exercise uses PDAL to subsample or thin point cloud data. This might"
" be done to accelerate processing (less data), normalize point density, "

"As we showed in the :ref:`density` exercise, the points in the "
"`uncompahgre.laz` file are not evenly distributed across the entire "
"collection. While we will not get into reasons why that particular "
"property is good or bad, we note there are three different sampling "
"strategies we could choose. We can attempt to preserve shape, we can try "
"to randomly sample, and we can attempt to normalize posting density. PDAL"
" provides capability for all three:"
