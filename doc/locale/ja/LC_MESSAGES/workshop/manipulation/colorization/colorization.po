"This exercise uses PDAL to apply color information from a raster onto "
"point data. Point cloud data, especially |LiDAR|, do not often have "
"coincident color information. It is possible to project color information"
" onto the points from an imagery source. This makes it convenient to see "
"data in a larger context."
