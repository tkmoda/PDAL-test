"As discussed :ref:`in the introduction <georeferencing-introduction>`, "
"laser returns from a mobile |LiDAR| system must be georeferenced, i.e. "
"placed into a local or global coordinate system by combining data from "
"the laser and from a GNSS/IMU.  As of this writing, PDAL does **not** "
"include generic georeferencing tools — this is considered future work.  "
"However, the |Optech| csd file format includes both laser return and "
"GNSS/IMU data in the same file, and the PDAL csd reader includes built in"
" georeferencing support."

"`Optech's <http://www.teledyneoptech.com/>`__ csd format is just one of "

"The file `S1C1_csd_004.csd` contains airborne data from an |Optech| "
"sensor. Without georeferencing these points, they would be impossible to "
"interpret — once they are georeferenced, we will be able to inspect and "
"analyze these points like any other point cloud."

"Because these are raw data coming from the sensor, these data are noisy."
"  In particular, there are a few points *very* close to the sensor which "
"were probably caused by air returns or laser light reflecting off of part"
" of the airplane or sensor.  These points have very high intensity "
"values, which will screw up our visualization.  We will use the "
":ref:`filters.expression` PDAL filter to drop all points with very high "
"intensity values."
