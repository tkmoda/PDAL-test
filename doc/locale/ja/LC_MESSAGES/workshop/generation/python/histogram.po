"PDAL doesn't provide every possible analysis option, but it strives to "
"make it convenient to link PDAL to other places with substantial "
"functionality.  One of those is the Python/Numpy universe, which is "
"accessed through PDAL's :ref:`python` bindings and the "
":ref:`filters.python` filter. These tools allow you to manipulate point "
"cloud data with convenient Python tools rather than constructing "
"substantial C/C++ software to achieve simple tasks, compute simple "
"statistics, or investigate data quality issues."

"This exercise uses PDAL to create a histogram plot of all of the "
"dimensions of a file. `matplotlib`_ is a Python package for plotting "
"graphs and figures, and we can use it in combination with the "
":ref:`python` bindings for PDAL to create a nice histogram. These "
"histograms can be useful diagnostics in an analysis pipeline. We will "
"combine a Python script to make a histogram plot with a "
":ref:`pipeline_command`."

"The following Python script will do the actual work of creating the "
"histogram plot with `matplotlib`_. Store it as ``histogram.py`` next to "
"the ``histogram.json`` :ref:`pipeline` file above.  The script is mostly "
"regular Python except for the ``ins`` and ``outs`` arguments to the "
"function -- those are special arguments that PDAL expects to be a "
"dictionary of Numpy dictionaries."
