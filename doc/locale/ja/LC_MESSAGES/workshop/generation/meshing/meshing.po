"This exercise uses PDAL to create surface meshes. PDAL is able to use a "
"number of meshing filters: https://pdal.io/en/latest/stages/filters.html."
" Three of these are 'in the box', without needing plugins compiled. These"
" are 2D Delaunay triangulation, Greedy projection meshing and Poisson "
"surface meshing."
