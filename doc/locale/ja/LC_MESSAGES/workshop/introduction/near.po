"This exercise uses PDAL to find points near a given search location. Our "
"scenario is a simple one -- we want to find the two points nearest the "
"midpoint of the bounding cube of our ``interesting.las`` data file."

"First we need to find the midpoint of the bounding cube. To do that, we "
"need to print the ``--all`` info for the file and look for the ``bbox`` "

"PDAL uses `JSON`_ as the exchange format when printing information from "
":ref:`info_command`.  JSON is a structured, human-readable format that is"
" much simpler than its `XML`_ cousin."

msgid ""
"The ``--query`` option of :ref:`info_command` constructs a `KD-tree`_ of "
"the entire set of points in memory. If you have really large data sets, "
"this isn't going to work so well, and you will need to come up with a "
"different solution."
