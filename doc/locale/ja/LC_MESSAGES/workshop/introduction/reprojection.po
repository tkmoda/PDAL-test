"Some formats, like :ref:`writers.las` do not automatically set scaling "

"number of ways to trip up. For latitude/longitude data, you will need to "
"set the scale to smaller values like ``0.0000001``. Additionally, LAS "
"uses an offset value to move the origin of the value. Use PDAL to set "
"that to ``auto`` so you don't have to compute it."

"system is not correct, not completely specified, or your system doesn't "
