"The ``random`` command is used to create a random point cloud. It uses "
":ref:`readers.faux` to create a point cloud containing ``count`` points "
"drawn randomly from either a uniform or normal distribution. For the "
"uniform distribution, the bounds can be specified (they default to a unit"
" cube). For the normal distribution, the mean and standard deviation can "
"both be set for each of the x, y, and z dimensions."
