"The ``tindex`` command is used to create a `GDAL`_-style tile index for "
"PDAL-readable point cloud types (see `gdaltindex`_)."

"The ``tindex`` command has two modes.  The first mode creates a spatial "
"index file for a set of point cloud files.  The second mode creates a "
"point cloud file that is the result of merging the points from files "
"referred to in a spatial index file that meet some criteria (usually a "
"geographic region filter)."

"This command will index the files referred to by ``filespec`` and place "
"the result in ``tindex``.  The ``tindex`` is a vector file or database "
"that will be created by ``pdal`` as necessary to store the file index. "
"The type of the index file can be specified by specifying the OGR code "
"for the format using the ``--ogrdriver`` option.  If no driver is "
"specified, the format defaults to \"ESRI Shapefile\".  Any filetype that "
"can be handled by `OGR <http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html>`_ is "
"acceptable."

"In vector file-speak, each file specified by ``filespec`` is stored as a "
"feature in a layer in the index file. The ``filespec`` is a `glob pattern"
" <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html>`_.  and normally "
"needs to be quoted to prevent shell expansion of wildcard characters."
