"contain points classified as ground (class 2) and medium vegetation "

"Most of the returned metrics will be self explanatory, with scores "
"reported both for individual classes and at a summary level. The returned"
" confusion matrix is presented in row-major order, where each row "
"corresponds to a truth label (the last row is a catch-all for any "
"unlabeled or ignored entries). Similarly, confusion matrix columns "
"correspond to predicted labels where the last column is once again a "
"catch-all for unlabeled entries. Although unlabeled/ignored truth labels "
"are reported in the confusion matrix, they are excluded from all computed"
" scores."
