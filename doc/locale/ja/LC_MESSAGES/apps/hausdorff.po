"The ``hausdorff`` command is used to compute the Hausdorff distance "
"between two point clouds. In this context, the Hausdorff distance is the "
"greatest of all Euclidean distances from a point in one point cloud to "
"the closest point in the other point cloud."

"The ``hausdorff`` is computed for XYZ coordinates only and as such says "
