"As of PDAL v2.6.0, the ``chamfer`` command is marked as DEPRECATED. It "
"will be removed from the default install in PDAL v2.7 and removed "
"completely in PDAL v2.8."

"The following Python code can be used with the PDAL Python bindings to "

"Popular Python packages such as scipy and sklearn have functions to "
"compute the pairwise distance between points and can be used to simplify "
"the above somewhat."

"Note that the provided code does not match exactly the output of PDAL's "
"original implementation, which summed the square of the distance to the "
"nearest neighbor. We have elected not to update the PDAL implementation "
"at this time."

"The ``chamfer`` command is used to compute the Chamfer distance between "
"two point clouds. The Chamfer distance is computed by summing the squared"
" distances between nearest neighbor correspondences of two point clouds."

"The command returns 0 along with a JSON-formatted message summarizing the"
