"PDAL's community interacts through `Mailing List`_, `GitHub`_, `Gitter`_ "
"and `IRC`_.  Please feel welcome to ask questions and participate in all "
"of the venues.  The `Mailing List`_ communication channel is for general "
"questions, development discussion, and feedback. The `GitHub`_ "
"communication channel is for development activities, bug reports, and "
"testing. The `IRC`_ and `Gitter`_ channels are for real-time chat "
"activities such as meetings and interactive debugging sessions."
